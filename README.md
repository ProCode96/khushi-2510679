C Project Work
The aim of this project is to create a 
Time Conversion Tool that converts a 
given number of seconds into hours, 
minutes, and seconds and displays the 
result in a readable format.
HH:MM:SS
The necessity for a time conversion tool stems from the logistical friction of a hyper-connected 2026 economy, where global teams must navigate shifting Daylight Saving Time rules and the mental tax of calculating cross-border overlaps. Its core utility lies in automating precision math—mapping local times via the formula $T_{target} = T_{source} + (Offset_{target} - Offset_{source})$—while providing developers with seamless translation between Unix timestamps and human-readable formats. Looking ahead, the scope of these tools will evolve from simple calculators into AI-driven "contextual schedulers" that manage human energy cycles and even "Relativistic Converters" to synchronize communications for emerging lunar and Martian infrastructure.
Reinforces logic for 12/24-hour or unit conversions; improves handling of structs (tm), modular arithmetic, and edge cases; builds foundational skills for real-world apps like clocks or schedulers.
